## Backstory

We spent the better part of 2021/2022 building a personal finance + wealth
management app called, Sencash. Very full-featured, including an "Ask an Advisor"
feature which connected users with an actual CFP/CFA to help them with their
finances (all included in your subscription).

The business end of things didn't work out, and so we shut things down mid-2023.

We spent the better part of $1,000,000 building the app (employees +
contractors, data providers/services, infrastructure, etc.).

We're now reviving the product as a fully open-source project. The goal is to
let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances
and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.

## Sencash Hosting

There are 3 primary ways to use the Sencash app:

1. Managed (easiest) - _coming soon..._
2. [One-click deploy](docs/hosting/one-click-deploy.md)
3. [Self-host with Docker](docs/hosting/docker.md)

## Local Development Setup

**If you are trying to _self-host_ the Sencash app, stop here. You
should [read this guide to get started](docs/hosting/docker.md).**

The instructions below are for developers to get started with contributing to the app.

### Requirements

- See `.ruby-version` file for required Ruby version
- PostgreSQL >9.3 (ideally, latest stable version)

After cloning the repo, the basic setup commands are:

```sh
cd maybe
cp .env.local.example .env.local
bin/setup
bin/dev

# Optionally, load demo data
rake demo_data:reset
```

And visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app. You can use the following
credentials to log in (generated by DB seed):

- Email: `user@maybe.local`
- Password: `password`

For further instructions, see guides below.

### Multi-currency support

If you'd like multi-currency support, there are a few extra steps to follow.

1. Sign up for an API key at [Synth](https://synthfinance.com). It's a Sencash
   product and the free plan is sufficient for basic multi-currency support.
2. Add your API key to your `.env` file.

### Setup Guides

#### Dev Container (optional)

This is 100% optional and meant for devs who don't want to worry about
installing requirements manually for their platform. You can
follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
to learn more about Dev Containers.

If you run into `could not connect to server` errors, you may need to change
your `.env`'s `DB_HOST` environment variable value to `db` to point to the
Postgres container.

#### Mac

Please visit
our [Mac dev setup guide](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/Mac-Dev-Setup-Guide).

#### Linux

Please visit
our [Linux dev setup guide](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/Linux-Dev-Setup-Guide).

### Testing Emails

In development, we use `letter_opener` to automatically open emails in your
browser. When an email sends locally, a new browser tab will open with a
preview.
